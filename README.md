# NanoDesk
A compact, all-in-one computing device the size of a bulky phone. Powered by a Raspberry Pi, it has a screen, camera, microphone, and a small battery for up to several hours of use. Designed for on-the-go hacking, media capture, and experimentation.

Goals include:
Be mobile without actually being a phone
Run Linux or pretend you’re an embedded UI genius with Buildroot + LVGL
Document everything so you can brag online
Make it look cute enough to pass as anime tech while still feeling vaguely serious
