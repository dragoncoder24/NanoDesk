1. Roadmap
Short-term goals

Complete compact Raspberry Pi “phone” build.

Implement basic software stack: Linux + custom UI or LVGL for touch interface.

Add functional audio (speaker + mic) and camera modules.

Battery management: monitor voltage, enable sleep/wake mode, and power-efficient routines.

Mid-term goals

Improve UI aesthetics: cute anime vibe + slight tech/masculine energy.

Optimize hardware placement and wiring for reliability and portability.

Explore lightweight local AI/assistant apps running on-device.

Add optional sensors or peripherals (e.g., extra buttons, haptic feedback, small storage).

Long-term goals

Fully standalone, portable device capable of running lightweight computing tasks.

Remote update and monitoring system.

Potential small batch production: standardized PCB, enclosure, and firmware image.

2. Lessons Learned
Hardware

Component selection is critical: power consumption, size, and compatibility matter.

Screen and touch calibration are tricky on non-standard displays.

Software

Linux is versatile, but lightweight UI libraries (LVGL) make small devices usable.

Sleep and power management are non-trivial on Pi; planning ahead saves headaches.

Firmware design needs to consider future expandability.

Project Management

Documenting BOM, links, and prices from the start prevents confusion later.

Versioning and language support (e.g., JSON vs XLSX) requires careful planning.

Testing each subsystem separately (screen, camera, audio) saves debugging time.

3. Reflection

Combining software and hardware projects is surprisingly messy but fun.

Multi-disciplinary knowledge (electronics, programming, UI design) pays off.

Small prototypes teach faster than theoretical planning alone.
